# 🚧 Road Accident Metadata Dashboard – Power BI Project

A comprehensive and interactive Power BI dashboard built to analyze road accident metadata. This project visualizes key performance indicators such as casualty severity, accident types, vehicle involvement, road conditions, location-based distribution, and time-of-day trends. It is designed to support road safety analysis, inform transport policy, and highlight actionable insights for reducing traffic-related casualties.

## 🗂️ Project Overview

Road traffic accidents remain a major public safety concern globally. This Power BI project takes a structured dataset of road accidents and transforms it into a visually engaging and informative dashboard that allows users to:

- Identify trends and patterns in traffic-related casualties
- Understand which vehicle types and road types are most involved in accidents
- Compare urban and rural casualty rates
- Track how accident severity varies by time of day
- Observe monthly trends in accident occurrence
- Visualize location-based accident distribution on a global map

This project aims to demonstrate how powerful storytelling with data can help improve awareness and decision-making in public safety and urban planning.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Provide a holistic view of road accident data through intuitive visualizations
- Reveal underlying patterns in casualty severity and vehicle involvement
- Empower users to explore the impact of road conditions and location
- Enable data-driven decision-making for government agencies and traffic safety professionals
- Showcase data analysis, transformation, and storytelling skills using Power BI
